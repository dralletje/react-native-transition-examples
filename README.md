# React native transition - Examples

Because I'm too bad with setting up stuff properly,
here the (weird) instructions on getting the examples running.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dralletje/react-native-transition-examples.git
```
Clone this repo.

```
$ cd react-native-transition
```
Go into the folder where it is cloned to.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dralletje/react-native-transition.git
```
Clone the new repo INSIDE OF IT!!!

```
$ npm install
```
Install the dependencies of the examples (includes the deps of react-native-transition)

```
$ react-native run-ios
```
Sit back and relax
